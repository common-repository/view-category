== Description ==

View Category adds a "View Category" button on the "Edit Category" page, next to the header and submit button. This works for Post Tags, and even custom taxonomies.

By default WordPress, doesn't allow you to quickly go to the category page.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `view-category` folder into your plugin directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

== Why I Created It ==
